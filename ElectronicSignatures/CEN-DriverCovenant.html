        <p>Leaders and volunteers are expected to aspire to live a life committed to follow Jesus, and aspire to live by faith, be a voice of hope and known by love.

            <li>I understand that in my serving role I am doing work for the Kingdom of God.  I agree to conduct myself in a manner that will be consistent with the values and mission of Crossings both in my volunteer role and in my daily life. (1 John 2:5-6)</li>
            <li>I understand that as I volunteer, I am expected to treat others as Jesus would treat them if He were here in my place.  This includes: thinking the best of one another and going through the proper channels in conflict. (see Matthew 18)</li>
            <li>I agree as a volunteer I agree to ensure not exceed the maximum capacity of the vehicle, drive safely, drive conservatively, not to drive beyond approved guidelines, and  uphold our policy of driver will not be alone with any participants or another volunteer. There needs to be a minimum of 3 people in the vehicle.</li>
            <li>I understand that as a volunteer, I am here to assist in carrying out the mission of the transportation ministry.  I understand that considerable responsibility comes with providing a safe environment while driving participants involved in this ministry.</li>
            <li>I am committed to upholding the standards outlined in the Transportation Policy Manual in regards to vehicle check, mileage recording, filling gas tank by ministry as well as the churchâ€™s moral standards for leadership.  If anything changes in my life that opposes these guidelines and standards I will notify staff.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="padding-top:5px;">I understand the above expectations that Crossings Community Church has of me as a Transportation Ministry Driver and I am committed to doing my best to fill these expectations.</p>
